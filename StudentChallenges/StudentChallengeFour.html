<!--Instructions: 
    1. From this starter kit, you will be making multiple files. 
    You decide how to best do that.
    2. Make changes to the HTML file to include a div, span, section, 
    header and footer element. 
    3. Extract the CSS into its own file and properly link it. 
    The styling should not be impacted. 
    4. Add a local image into your HTML file.
